# Advanced MEV Strategy

This project implements a sophisticated MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) strategy focused on flash loan-based sandwich attacks and arbitrage opportunities. It's designed to analyze market conditions, identify profitable opportunities, and execute them atomically using various DeFi protocols.

## Features

- **Flash Loan Integration**: Uses Aave and Balancer for flash loans
- **Sandwich Attack Implementation**: Front-running and back-running transactions with optimal sizing
- **Multi-Hop Sandwich**: Execute sandwich attacks across multiple DEXes in a single transaction
- **Arbitrage Detection**: Find and exploit price differences between DEXes
- **Combined Strategies**: Execute both sandwich and arbitrage in a single transaction
- **Gas Optimization**: Advanced gas price management for maximum efficiency
- **Economic Security**: Built-in profitability checks and revert mechanisms
- **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including mainnet fork tests

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or later
- Yarn or npm package manager
- Ethereum wallet with private key (for mainnet deployment)
- Infura or Alchemy API key (for mainnet interaction)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mev-strategy.git
   cd mev-strategy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your configuration settings:
   - Add your private key (without 0x prefix)
   - Add your Infura/Alchemy API key
   - Configure other settings as needed

## Usage

### Compile Contracts

```bash
npm run compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run mainnet fork tests
npm run test:fork

# Generate gas usage report
npm run test:gas

# Generate test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Deploy Contracts

```bash
# Deploy to mainnet
npm run deploy:mainnet

# Deploy to Goerli testnet
npm run deploy:goerli

# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

### Run MEV Simulations

```bash
# Simulate MEV strategies
npm run simulate

# Analyze profitability
npm run analyze:profit

# Scan for MEV opportunities
npm run scan
```

### Start a Local Node with Mainnet Fork

```bash
# Start a local node with mainnet fork
npm run fork
```

## Configuration

- Update `utils/constants.js` to adjust token addresses, DEX addresses, and strategy settings
- Modify `utils/token-pairs.js` to target specific token pairs
- Adjust gas settings in `utils/gas-price-manager.js`

## Development and Testing

For development, you can use the local Hardhat network with mainnet forking:

```bash
npm run fork
```

This will start a local node that forks from the Ethereum mainnet, allowing you to test your strategies with real-world contracts and liquidity.

## Security Notes

- Never commit your private key or API keys to git
- Always test thoroughly before deploying to mainnet
- Start with small amounts when testing on mainnet
- Implement proper monitoring and kill-switches for production deployments
- Consider using multi-sig wallets for managing strategy funds
